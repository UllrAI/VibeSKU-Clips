# AI Agent Integration (Vercel AI SDK)

VibeSKU Clips ships an agent-ready AI stack built on the [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev) v7:
a multi-step agent loop, a tool registry, a composable skill system, and a streaming chat API.
The operator dashboard does not expose a general-purpose assistant; this stack remains available
for purpose-built product integrations.

```

Request flow: the chat route authenticates the session, builds an `AgentContext`, resolves an
agent factory from the registry, and returns `createAgentUIStreamResponse`. The agent is a
`ToolLoopAgent`: it calls the model, executes tool calls, and loops until the model finishes
or `isStepCount` stops it.

Conversations and UI messages are stored under the authenticated user in PostgreSQL. The API
supports creating, switching, archiving, restoring, and paginating history in batches of 80
messages.
The server accepts one new message or approval decision with a parent ID and derives the
provider response handle from stored history. Each user may have one running response.
A three-minute abort, five-step limit, and 4096 output-token limit bound each run.
The response, pending media message, and usage commit together. The Worker retries R2
storage independently; stale media retries cannot overwrite a later reply. A process
killed before that transaction leaves a reserved interrupted run and is not automatically
replayed. See [architecture boundaries and recovery](architecture.md).

Clients can attach up to six PNG, JPEG, or WebP reference images to each message, including an
image-only message. They upload through the existing R2 flow before sending, and the durable URLs
are stored as UI message file parts. The chat route verifies every URL against an
upload owned by the authenticated user and issues short-lived signed reads before passing it to the model, so clients cannot inject
arbitrary external images or another user's files. The supported formats follow the
[OpenAI image-input guidance](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/images-vision).

## Configuration

The stack uses the OpenAI Responses protocol so reasoning and function tools work together.
`LLM_BASE_URL` remains configurable for gateways that implement the Responses API.

| Setting            | Where                                                                     | Notes                                                          |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature switch     | `SITE_CONFIG.features.ai` in `src/lib/config/site.js`                     | Gates the API routes.                                          |
| `LLM_API_KEY`      | `.env`                                                                    | Required while the feature is enabled.                         |
| `LLM_BASE_URL`     | `.env`                                                                    | Optional Responses API base URL.                               |
| `AI_DEFAULT_MODEL` | `.env`                                                                    | Optional; defaults to `openai/gpt-5.6-luna`.                   |
| Daily allowances   | `AI_DAILY_TOKEN_LIMIT` / `AI_DAILY_IMAGE_LIMIT` in `src/lib/ai/limits.ts` | Rolling 24h admission: 2,000,000 units and 10 images per user. |

The assistant defaults to `low` reasoning; the client may select `low`, `medium`, or `high` per
request. Image generation is intentionally fixed in code to GPT Image 2, low quality, WebP output,
and at most one built-in tool call per model response. The latest user request selects one of the
application's 1K presets: `1024x1024`, `1536x1024`, or `1024x1536`; unsupported dimensions are
mapped to the closest orientation instead of widening the output limit. These presets follow the
[official GPT Image 2 size guidance](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/image-generation#size-and-quality-options).
A custom gateway must support both the Responses protocol and the OpenAI image-generation built-in
tool for that feature to work.

To use another vendor, change `src/lib/ai/models.ts` only — for example install
`@ai-sdk/anthropic` and swap `createOpenAI` for `createAnthropic`. Tools, skills, agents, and
routes remain provider-agnostic.

Mutating tools must be idempotent using the authenticated user, conversation ID, and SDK
`toolCallId`. Approval signatures establish consent, not exactly-once execution. Uploads
disabled means both document storage and image generation are unavailable.

## Adding a tool

Two steps: create the file, then register it.

```ts
// 1. src/lib/ai/tools/get-open-invoices.ts
import { tool } from "ai";
import { z } from "zod";
import type { AgentContext } from "../context";

export function createGetOpenInvoices(context: AgentContext) {
  return tool({
    description: "List the signed-in user's open invoices.",
    inputSchema: z.object({
      limit: z.number().int().positive().max(20).default(5),
    }),
    execute: async ({ limit }) => {
      // context.userId comes from the session, never from the model.
      return listOpenInvoices(context.userId, limit);
    },
  });
}
```

```ts
// 2. src/lib/ai/tools/index.ts
export const agentTools = {
  // ...existing tools
  getOpenInvoices: createGetOpenInvoices,
} satisfies Record<string, (context: AgentContext) => ToolSet[string]>;
```

Every tool is a factory over `AgentContext`, so tools that need no context simply ignore the
argument. The registry key is the name the model sees, which means each name is defined exactly
once and two tools can never collide.

## Tools that change data

A tool that creates, updates, or deletes anything must set `needsApproval: true`. The dividing
line is whether the user could undo it: `presentArtifact` only shows a document, so it runs
freely; `saveDocument` writes an R2 object and consumes storage quota, so it asks first.

```ts
export function createSaveDocument(context: AgentContext) {
  return tool({
    description: "Save a Markdown document to the user's files.",
    inputSchema: z.object({ fileName: z.string(), content: z.string() }),
    needsApproval: true,
    execute: async ({ fileName, content }) => {
      /* ... */
    },
  });
}
```

The tool loop then pauses instead of executing, and the stream emits an approval request. Any
client that consumes the chat API must render that request, record the answer with
`addToolApprovalResponse`, and resume only after the signed approval response is complete.

The approval itself travels through the client, so it is signed. `withToolApprovalSecret` in
`src/lib/ai/tool-approval.ts` attaches an HMAC key derived from `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` to every
agent; the SDK signs each approval request and verifies the response before executing the tool.
**This is not optional.** When no secret is configured the SDK skips verification entirely, and a
crafted request body can approve its own tool call — the gate becomes decoration. That failure is
silent, which is why the secret is derived rather than read from a separate environment variable,
and why `src/lib/ai/tool-approval.test.ts` asserts that an unsigned approval is rejected.

A denied call ends up in the `output-denied` state and the model is told the user refused, so
tools should still return a plain result object on business failures (quota exhausted, file too
large) rather than throwing.

Show the user what a write tool produced. `ToolCallRow` renders `saveDocument`'s output as a link
to the stored file; without that the transcript reads "Used saveDocument" and the user who just
granted permission cannot tell where the file went. Because business failures arrive on the same
`output-available` state, `readSavedDocument` checks the shape instead of assuming it.

## Adding a skill

A skill bundles a system-prompt fragment with the tools it needs, so one import gives an agent
both the knowledge and the capability:

```ts
// src/lib/ai/skills/invoicing.ts
import type { AgentSkill } from "./types";

export const invoicingSkill: AgentSkill = {
  id: "invoicing",
  instructions: `Use the getOpenInvoices tool before answering invoice questions; never guess amounts.`,
  toolNames: ["getOpenInvoices"],
};
```

Register it in `src/lib/ai/skills/index.ts`, then add it to an agent's skill list. Skills
reference tools by registry name, so `toolNames` is type-checked and two skills may share a
tool without conflict. Prompt-only skills (tone, policies, escalation rules) omit `toolNames`.

## Adding an agent

Agents are request-scoped `ToolLoopAgent` instances composed from skills:

```ts
// src/lib/ai/agents/support.ts
export function createSupportAgent(
  context: AgentContext,
  options: CreateAgentOptions,
) {
  const { instructions, toolNames } = composeSkills([
    agentSkills.accountSupport,
    agentSkills.invoicing,
  ]);
  return new ToolLoopAgent({
    model: getChatModel(),
    reasoning: options.reasoningEffort,
    instructions: `You are the support agent. ...\n\n${instructions}`,
    tools: buildTools(toolNames, context),
    stopWhen: isStepCount(10),
  });
}
```

Add the factory to `agentFactories` in `src/lib/ai/agents/index.ts`; the chat route then accepts
`{ "agentId": "support" }` in the request body (default is `assistant`).

## The chat API

`POST /api/chat` expects a Vercel AI SDK UI message payload (`useChat` sends it automatically):

- Session cookie auth; `401` without a signed-in user.
- Rate limited per user (30 requests / 10 minutes, `ai_chat` scope).
- Body capped at 512 KB and 80 messages.
- Requires a user-owned `conversationId`; another user's or a missing conversation returns `404`.
- Accepts only `low`, `medium`, or `high` reasoning effort and defaults to `low`.
- Accepts at most six PNG, JPEG, or WebP reference images per user message and verifies each
  image against the authenticated user's upload records.
- Streams a UI message response, including tool-call parts the client can render.
- Provider errors are logged server-side and masked in the stream; a misconfigured agent
  answers `500` and an unusable message payload answers `400`, neither leaking details.

`AgentContext` is built from the session on the server, so no field a client sends can widen
what a tool may read.

Successful turns expose a signed, user-bound response handle in message metadata. On the next
turn the client sends only messages created after that response, and the server verifies the
handle before using the underlying Responses API `previous_response_id`. This keeps generated
image payloads out of later request bodies and prevents a client from chaining to another user's
response. Provider response storage is enabled because native response chaining requires it.
The user message is stored before the stream is returned, while the completed assistant message
is stored by the stream end callback. Regeneration updates the existing assistant message and
cannot overwrite a message with a different role.

## Usage accounting

Every completed assistant turn writes one `ai_usage_events` row: the user, conversation, message,
agent, model, reasoning effort, token counts, finish reason, and duration. This is the data layer
for cost attribution, quotas, and usage-based billing — request-count rate limiting cannot express
that a `high` reasoning turn costs far more than a lookup.

Two details are easy to get wrong:

- **Usage does not reach `onEnd`.** The AI SDK's stream-end event carries `finishReason` but no
  token counts. Those arrive on stream parts, so `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` captures `totalUsage`
  from the `finish` part and `response.modelId` from `finish-step` into closure variables, then
  writes one row from `onEnd`. Do not put usage into the `messageMetadata` return value — that is
  sent to the client.
- **The row counts language-model tokens only.** `generateImage` runs as a provider-executed tool,
  and its image tokens never appear in `LanguageModelUsage`. Image spend is billed but not captured
  here; costing that feature needs a separate source.

The `model` column records the model that served the final step. That is accurate only while a
single chat model serves the whole loop, which is today's configuration; introducing per-step model
selection would require per-step rows instead of one row per turn.

Token columns are nullable throughout. A provider that reports no cache tokens is not the same as
one reporting zero, and `extractUsageTotals` in `src/lib/ai/usage.ts` preserves that distinction
rather than defaulting to `0`. Accounting failures are logged and swallowed: a bookkeeping error
must never cost the user their reply. `messageId` carries no foreign key, and regenerating a turn
overwrites the message row while leaving a usage row per attempt — sum by user or conversation, not
by message.

## Testing

Agent code is unit-testable with Jest. The AI SDK packages are ESM-only, so they are listed in
`transpilePackages` in `next.config.ts` (which `next/jest` also uses), and `jest.setup.ts`
polyfills `TransformStream` for jsdom.

Patterns to copy: call a tool's `execute` directly (`tools/*.test.ts`), compose skills without a
context (`skills/compose.test.ts`), and cover a route by mocking session, rate limit, and agent
(`src/app/api/chat/route.test.ts`).
