# Docker setup for VibeSKU Clips

This directory contains the Docker configuration for running VibeSKU Clips in containers.

## Files

- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build configuration for the Next.js application
- `entrypoint.sh` - Drops root privileges when the hosting platform overrides
  the image user
- `docker-compose.yml` - Development environment with PostgreSQL
- Root `.dockerignore` - Excludes secrets and build artifacts

## Quick Start

1. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Copy the root environment template and fill in every required value:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

   Store the generated value in `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`. Set
   `RESEND_EMAIL_FROM` to an address on a domain verified in Resend. Set
   a second generated value in `UPLOAD_CLEANUP_SECRET`. Set
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to the exact public origin used to access the build;
   production SEO metadata is generated from this value at build time. Keep the
   upload bucket private and configure the four R2 credentials for both Web and
   Worker. User files use authenticated downloads and do not need a public CDN.
   `RATE_LIMIT_IP_HEADER` defaults to Zeabur's `x-forwarded-for`. Override it
   only when your trusted ingress uses a different supported header; never
   trust a header passed through directly from the public internet.

2. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   cd docker
   docker compose --env-file ../.env up --build
   ```

   Compose waits for PostgreSQL, applies every committed migration with the
   one-shot `migrate` service, and starts the Web and Worker services only after
   both the application and pg-boss migrations succeed.

3. **Access the application**
   - Application: http://localhost:3000
   - Database: localhost:5432

## Services

### app

- **Port**: 3000
- **Dependencies**: PostgreSQL
- **Health check**: Next.js application readiness

### worker

- **Purpose**: Claims and executes durable pg-boss jobs outside the Web process
- **Entrypoint**: `node dist/worker/worker.mjs` (Node is PID 1)
- **Shutdown**: Stops claiming, drains active handlers for 30 seconds, then closes both pools

### migrate

- **Purpose**: Applies committed Drizzle migrations and pg-boss schema migrations before runtime services start
- **Lifecycle**: Exits successfully after migrations complete

### postgres

- **Port**: 5432
- **Database**: `vibesku_clips`
- **Credentials**: postgres/postgres (development only)
- **Persistence**: Docker volume `postgres_data`

## Development Workflow

1. **Database Migrations**

   ```bash
   # Re-run the one-shot committed migration service
   docker compose --env-file ../.env run --rm migrate

   # Generate migrations on the host after changing the schema
   pnpm db:generate
   ```

2. **Logs**

   ```bash
   # View application and Worker logs
   docker compose logs -f app
   docker compose logs -f worker

   # View all services
   docker compose logs -f
   ```

3. **Shell Access**

   ```bash
   # Access database
   docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d vibesku_clips
   ```

## Production Considerations

For production deployment:

1. **Security**: Change all default passwords and secrets
2. **Environment**: Use production environment variables
3. **Volumes**: Configure persistent storage appropriately
4. **Network**: Use proper network configuration
5. **Health Checks**: Ensure all services have appropriate health checks
6. **Secrets**: Use Docker secrets or external secret management
7. **File maintenance**: Keep the Worker running with R2 credentials. It retries
   AI media finalization, abandoned uploads, and requested file deletions.
   For existing public buckets, follow the cutover in
   [architecture notes](../docs/architecture.md).
8. **Upload protocol rollout**: Set `UPLOAD_LEGACY_COMPLETION_SINCE` and
   `UPLOAD_LEGACY_COMPLETION_UNTIL` only for the bounded v1-to-v2 rollout
   window, then remove both after the cutoff
9. **Trusted proxy**: Keep the default loopback-only application port binding
   or place the container on a private network behind a reverse proxy. The
   proxy must overwrite `RATE_LIMIT_IP_HEADER`; exposing port 3000 publicly
   while trusting a client-supplied header makes IP rate limits bypassable.
10. **Connection budget**: Budget `DB_POOL_SIZE + JOB_DB_POOL_SIZE` per Worker,
    and the application pool plus `JOB_DB_POOL_SIZE` for each Web replica that
    enqueues tasks. The Compose defaults use 8 connections per Worker.

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is ready
docker compose exec postgres pg_isready -U postgres

# Reset database
docker compose down -v
docker compose --env-file ../.env up --build
```

### Build Issues

Rebuild the application images without removing unrelated Docker data:

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose --env-file ../.env build --no-cache app migrate
docker compose --env-file ../.env up
```
