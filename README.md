# VibeSKU Clips

[中文版](README.zh-CN.md) | English

VibeSKU Clips turns product material into localised 15-second UGC video for
TikTok Shop account matrices. An operator submits a product link or images with a
brief; the platform reads the product, writes a market-specific script, generates
and edits the clip, checks it against a quality gate, and hands back grouped
assets with a delivery manifest.

The platform produces material and the manifest. Account login, publishing,
storefront links, product tagging, and performance observation stay with the
operations team.

## ✨ What it does

- **Product understanding.** Reads a product link, uploaded images, and a brief
  into recorded product facts. Anything the material does not support is flagged
  for a top-up rather than invented.
- **Localised scripts.** Output language and target market are separate
  settings, so Spanish for Mexico and Spanish for Spain are different scripts,
  each with its own voiceover, subtitles, and publish caption.
- **Three delivery formats.** Presenter, everyday scene, and how-to-use, each a
  production recipe with its own beat structure and rotating opening angles.
- **Talent consistency.** Upload a licensed photo or describe a fictional adult
  performer. The generated opening frame anchors the look for the whole clip.
- **Batches that count what you asked for.** Products, scripts, clips per
  script, and talent are explicit per line; nothing is cross-multiplied.
- **A quality gate before review.** Duration, voiceover length, caption safe
  area, product accuracy, performer consistency, and local expression are
  checked on every clip.
- **Review and regeneration.** Grouped comparison with similarity hints, three
  decision states, retry for failures, and regeneration that keeps the original.
- **Exports with a manifest.** Grouped by product or account tag, with the
  reference number, product, variant, language, market, talent, licence note,
  and disclosure line for every asset.
- **Asset and consumption records.** Products, talent, scripts, and approved
  clips keep their source, licence, and version lineage; analysis, scripting,
  rendering, retries, and regenerations are metered separately.

Delivery specification: 15 seconds, 9:16, 1080×1920, with cover, subtitles,
publish caption, and a synthetic-content disclosure.

## 🧱 How production runs

| Stage     | Job                  | What it does                                                                                                    |
| :-------- | :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Intake    | `ugc.product.ingest` | Fetches the product page, reads facts from the material, and pauses only that product when something is missing |
| Planning  | `ugc.batch.run`      | Expands the plan lines, writes the scripts, creates the clip rows, and queues rendering                         |
| Rendering | `ugc.clip.render`    | Generates the opening frame, then the clip, archives both, writes the subtitle track, and runs the quality gate |

Jobs run on pg-boss through the repository's task-run outbox, so a batch
survives a restart and every clip can be retried on its own. Media generation
goes through Prism (`src/lib/ugc/media`), and scripting through any
OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

Business logic lives in `src/lib/ugc`, the job handlers in `src/lib/jobs/ugc`,
and the operator surfaces under `src/app/dashboard`.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

Ensure you have the following software installed in your development environment:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 22 or newer
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### 2. Project Clone & Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/UllrAI/VibeSKU-Clips.git

# Enter project directory
cd vibesku-clips

# Install dependencies with pnpm
pnpm install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

The project is configured through environment variables. First, copy the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and fill in the core values plus the credentials for the
features enabled in `src/lib/config/site.js`.

#### Starter feature selection

`SITE_CONFIG` is the client-safe source of truth for brand, contact, links,
assets, and the static `emailAuth`, `billing`, `uploads`, and `ai` feature
switches. All features default to enabled. Disable an unused feature there before
removing its environment variables. Disabled features are removed from
navigation and guarded at their pages, APIs, plugins, and server actions.

If `emailAuth` is disabled, configure at least one complete OAuth provider so
the web sign-in flow remains usable. Credentials remain server-only and must
never be added to `SITE_CONFIG`.

#### Environment Variables

> `openssl rand -base64 32`
>
> **Optional local CLI auth:** for scripts, local agents, or quick terminal access, you can export `VIBESKU_CLIPS_CLI_API_KEY=ssk_...` instead of storing credentials in the CLI config.

#### Analytics

Umami tracking is optional and disabled unless all three public Umami variables
are set. Each deployment must create its own website in Umami and use its own
website ID; never copy the maintainer deployment's ID into a fork. The tracker
honors Do Not Track, excludes URL search parameters, and only records the hosts
listed in `NEXT_PUBLIC_UMAMI_DOMAINS`.

The stable event vocabulary is `cta_click`, `signup_click`, `signup_submit`,
`signup_link_sent`, `login_submit`, `login_link_sent`, `signup_success`,
`pricing_view`, `payment_start`, and `payment_success`.
Tracking is best-effort and never controls authentication or billing behavior.
Umami's accounting remains separate from provider webhooks and database records.

This configuration is cookieless, but operators remain responsible for their
privacy notice and any consent flow required by the data they add or the
jurisdictions they serve. Verification and SEO measurement procedures are in
[SEO growth operations](docs/seo-growth.md).

- [How a batch counts](content/blog/en/counting-a-batch.md)

#### Stripe catalog setup

Test and live Stripe catalog IDs are intentionally separate in
`src/lib/billing/stripe/prices.ts`. Set `STRIPE_ENVIRONMENT` and its matching
`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, then run `pnpm stripe:sync-products`. Each tier owns one
stable Stripe Product; a price change creates a new Price under that Product,
deactivates the old Price for new checkouts, and leaves existing subscriptions
on their original amount. Webhooks resolve the tier from the Product ID, so no
finite or unbounded retired-Price list is needed. Review and commit the
selected-environment configuration change before deploying. Checkout fails
closed when the active environment has no configured Price ID.

Webhook retry, idempotency, and manual replay behavior are documented in
[Billing webhook operations](docs/webhooks.md).

### 4. Database Setup

This project uses a single Drizzle config file, `src/database/config.ts`, and a single committed migration history in `src/database/migrations/`. The target database is selected only by `DATABASE_URL`.

#### Local development

For fast local iteration against your own database:

```bash
pnpm db:push
```

If the schema change should be reviewed, committed, or shared with other environments, create and apply a real migration instead:

```bash
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
```

#### Staging and production

Shared environments should use committed SQL migrations only:

```bash
# 1. Generate and commit the migration from your schema change
pnpm db:generate

# 2. Run the committed migration once against the target DATABASE_URL
pnpm db:migrate

# 3. Deploy the application after the migration succeeds
```

> **Recommended release practice**
>
> - **Never** use `pnpm db:push` in staging or production.
> - Keep one migration history for all environments. Do not split migrations into dev/prod trees.
> - Run `pnpm db:migrate` as a dedicated one-shot release step in CI/CD or your deploy platform.
> - Do **not** run migrations on every application process startup.
> - Make schema changes backward-compatible when possible, so app rollout and migration timing stay safe.

### 5. Content Management (Content Collections)

The project uses Content Collections plus plain Markdown files for blog content. Posts live in locale-scoped paths such as `content/blog/en/*.md` and `content/blog/zh-Hans/*.md`, authors live in `content/authors/*.json`, and build-time generation produces typed collections for the blog pages and sitemap.

- **Authoring workflow:** Add or edit posts directly in the repository with frontmatter and Markdown content.
- **Generated content data:** Run `pnpm content:build` to refresh the generated collections manually. The Next.js plugin handles development and production builds; test and type-check scripts invoke the generator explicitly.
- **Production behavior:** There is no CMS admin route or runtime content API. All blog content is built from the repository content files.

### 6. Agent-Friendly API and CLI Auth

This starter distinguishes clearly between human auth and machine auth:

- **Browser users:** Better Auth session cookies for the web app
- **Server-to-server and agent access:** user-managed API keys
- **Local developer tools:** browser-approved device login via `vibesku-clips-cli`

What ships today:

- versioned machine endpoints under `/api/v1/*`
- API key creation and revocation in Dashboard Settings
- CLI session review and revocation in Dashboard Settings
- a terminal workflow for signing in from local tools without reusing browser session tokens

Quick examples:

```bash
# Sign in a local CLI through the browser
pnpm vibesku-clips-cli -- auth login --base-url http://localhost:3000

# Check current CLI auth state
pnpm vibesku-clips-cli -- auth status --base-url http://localhost:3000

# Use an API key for scripts or coding agents
VIBESKU_CLIPS_CLI_API_KEY=ssk_your_key_here pnpm vibesku-clips-cli -- auth status --base-url http://localhost:3000
```

The web app exposes management surfaces at `/dashboard/developer` for both API keys and authorized CLI sessions.

### 7. Start Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Now your application should be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!

### 8. Admin Account Setup

For security reasons, the first registered user is not promoted automatically. Use the admin script after the user has signed up normally:

```bash
pnpm set:admin --email=your-email@example.com
```

The command loads `.env` if it exists and otherwise uses the current process environment, so the same command works locally and on a server.

After successful execution, the user receives `super_admin` privileges and can access `/dashboard/admin`.

**Security tips**

- Grant this role only to trusted users.
- Run the command in a secure environment with the correct `DATABASE_URL`.

## 🧪 E2E Testing

This repository includes a Playwright smoke test suite in `e2e/` for the most important browser-level flows:

- unauthenticated dashboard redirect
- authenticated dashboard access
- admin permission gating
- locale canonicalization for marketing routes
- API key creation and machine-auth verification
- browser-approved device auth for CLI sign-in

## Layout Widths

- Use `ShellContainer` for the marketing header, footer, and other truly wide layouts.
- Use `SectionContainer` for standard marketing sections and non-dashboard page bodies.
- Use `ReadingContainer` for blog articles, legal pages, and other long-form reading surfaces.
- Use `CompactContainer` for auth flows.
- Use `FocusContainer` for payment status and other centered cards that need more space.
- Keep full-bleed backgrounds separate from content width. Backgrounds can span the viewport while content stays inside one semantic container.

Run the suite with:

```bash
createdb vibesku_e2e
# Add E2E_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../vibesku_e2e to .env
pnpm test:e2e
```

`E2E_DATABASE_URL` is mandatory and must point to a dedicated local PostgreSQL database whose name contains a standalone `e2e` or `test` segment. Outside CI, the runner rejects the regular `DATABASE_URL` to prevent test users, API keys, CLI tokens, device codes, and rate-limit state from reaching a development or shared database. It applies migrations, builds the app, starts the production server, and cleans E2E fixtures before and after the suite.

The test-only session route is enabled only while Playwright is running against the declared E2E database. It also requires an explicit `E2E_TEST_SECRET` of at least 32 characters and is disabled for non-local production deployments. Playwright generates a per-run secret when CI does not provide one.

## 📁 File Upload Feature

This project integrates a secure file upload system based on Cloudflare R2.
Direct and server-side uploads share the same short-lived upload intent,
per-user byte quotas, one-time completion, and orphan cleanup flow.

### 1. Cloudflare R2 Configuration

1. **Create R2 Bucket**: Log into Cloudflare Dashboard, navigate to R2 and create a new bucket.
2. **Get API Token**: In the R2 overview page, click "Manage R2 API Tokens", create a token with "Object Read & Write" permissions. Note down the `Access Key ID` and `Secret Access Key`.
3. **Set Environment Variables**: Fill your R2 credentials and information into the `.env` file.
4. **Configure CORS Policy**: To allow browsers to upload files directly, you need to configure CORS policy in your R2 bucket's "Settings". Add the following configuration, replacing the URLs in `AllowedOrigins` with your own:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["http://localhost:3000", "https://yourdomain.com"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["PUT"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["Content-Type", "If-None-Match"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  }
]
```

Direct uploads use protocol version 2. The presign response declares the
required `Content-Type` and `If-None-Match: *` headers, so an issued object key
can only be written once. The signed URL lasts 15 minutes and its database
reservation lasts one hour. Cancelling releases quota immediately without
shortening that original expiry. After expiry, cleanup deletes the object but
retains a tombstone for 24 hours and deletes the object again before removing
the intent. This second check catches a late PUT that began while the signed URL
was still valid. Clients built against the older unsigned-header protocol must
be refreshed when this version is deployed.

Every completion requires a database-backed intent; there is no unauthenticated
or key-only completion path. Per-user storage quotas are 1 GiB per rolling 24
hours and 5 GiB in total, defined as `DAILY_QUOTA_BYTES` and `TOTAL_QUOTA_BYTES`
in `src/lib/config/upload.ts`.

### 2. Schedule Upload Cleanup

Call the cleanup endpoint once per day from your deployment platform. It claims
expired upload intents and deletes abandoned R2 objects. At this cadence,
expired objects may remain until a later daily run. A tombstone that becomes
eligible just after the fixed run can wait through one additional daily cycle;
quota accounting stops counting intents as soon as they expire.

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $UPLOAD_CLEANUP_SECRET" \
  "https://yourdomain.com/api/internal/uploads/cleanup"
```

The endpoint processes up to five batches of 100 intents per run and recovers
stale cleanup claims automatically. If a run reports five full batches,
invoke it again or schedule it more frequently until the queue is drained. R2
lifecycle rules may additionally abort incomplete multipart uploads after one
day, but they do not replace this database-aware cleanup.

### 3. Using the `FileUploader` Component

We provide a powerful `FileUploader` component that supports drag-and-drop, progress display, image compression, and error handling.

#### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { FileUploader } from "@/components/ui/file-uploader";

function MyComponent() {
  const handleUploadComplete = (files) => {
    console.log("Upload complete:", files);
    // Handle uploaded file information here
  };

  return (
    <FileUploader
      acceptedFileTypes={["image/png", "image/jpeg", "application/pdf"]}
      maxFileSize={5 * 1024 * 1024} // 5MB
      maxFiles={3}
      onUploadComplete={handleUploadComplete}
    />
  );
}
```

> **Note**: This project uses a `src` directory structure. All components and library files are located in the `src/` directory and can be accessed through the `@/` path mapping which resolves to `src/`.

#### Image Compression

The component includes built-in client-side image compression functionality that can reduce image file size before upload, saving bandwidth and storage space.

```tsx
<FileUploader
  acceptedFileTypes={["image/png", "image/jpeg", "image/webp"]}
  enableImageCompression={true}
  imageCompressionQuality={0.7} // Compression quality (0.1-1.0)
  imageCompressionMaxWidth={1200} // Maximum width after compression
/>
```

## 📊 Bundle Size Monitoring & Optimization

This project integrates `@next/bundle-analyzer` to help you analyze and optimize your application's bundle size.

### How to Run Analysis

```bash
# Analyze production build
pnpm analyze

# Analyze in development mode
pnpm analyze:dev
```

After execution, bundle size analysis reports for both client and server will automatically open in your browser.

### Optimization Strategies

- **Dynamic Imports**: Use `next/dynamic` for code splitting of large components or libraries that aren't needed on first screen.
- **Dependency Optimization**:
  - **Tree Shaking**: Ensure you only import what you need from libraries, e.g., `import { debounce } from 'lodash-es';` instead of `import _ from 'lodash';`.
  - **Lightweight Alternatives**: Consider using lighter libraries, e.g., replace `moment.js` with `date-fns`.
- **Image Optimization**: Prioritize using Next.js `<Image>` component and enable WebP format.

## ☁️ Deployment

The production reference deployment uses [Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/). The
repository also includes a standalone multi-stage Docker build.

> **Save 10% on a Zeabur server:** Purchase a server at
> [Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/) and enter referral code `visoar` at checkout.

Configure the production Zeabur service to deploy the `prod` branch, not
the default development branch (`main` in this repository). Pushing a
`release/vX.Y.Z` tag matching the version in `package.json` runs
[`promote-release-to-prod.yml`](.github/workflows/promote-release-to-prod.yml),
which verifies that the tagged commit belongs to the repository's default
branch (`main` at present) before moving `prod` to that commit. Zeabur deploys
only after the promotion succeeds. Fork maintainers can reuse the same setup;
see [the Zeabur deployment guide](docs/deployment-zeabur.md#using-the-workflow-in-a-fork).

1. Merge the reviewed commit into the default branch and wait for the Quality
   workflow to pass.
2. Configure every required variable from `.env.example`. Set
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to the final HTTPS origin before building because
   canonical URLs and client configuration are compiled from it. Keep the user
   upload bucket private; see [architecture notes](docs/architecture.md#deployment-requirements).
3. Set `PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL` in the GitHub `production` environment, plus
   `PRODUCTION_JOB_DATABASE_URL` for a separate queue database. The release
   workflow checks the exact SHA's Quality result and runs migrations before promotion.
4. Update the version in `package.json`, then tag that commit with an annotated
   `release/vX.Y.Z` tag using the same version and push it:

   ```bash
   git tag -a release/v1.2.3 -m "Release v1.2.3"
   git push origin release/v1.2.3
   ```

5. Wait for the promotion workflow and the subsequent Zeabur deployment to
   succeed. Use `/api/health` for liveness and `/api/ready` for database-backed
   readiness.
6. Schedule an authenticated `POST /api/internal/uploads/cleanup` once per day.
7. Verify the public origin, both locale URL variants, authentication redirects,
   Dashboard access, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and application logs.

Docker Compose follows the same order with a one-shot `migrate` service. See
[docker/README.md](docker/README.md) for local and self-hosted instructions.
The optional GitHub maintenance schedule is best-effort and runs only from the
default branch. Enable scheduled Actions explicitly in a fork, monitor its
latest successful run, and use a platform scheduler when timing is an SLA.
